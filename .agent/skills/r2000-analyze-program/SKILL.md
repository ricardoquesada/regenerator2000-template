# Analyze Program Workflow

Use this skill when the user asks to "analyze this program", "analyze everything", "full analysis",
or wants a complete end-to-end pass over the loaded binary — classifying blocks, documenting
routines, and naming symbols.

This skill **orchestrates** the following existing skills in order:

1. `r2000-analyze-blocks` — Classify all memory regions (code vs data vs text, etc.).
2. `r2000-analyze-routine` — Analyze and document each subroutine.
3. `r2000-analyze-symbol` — Analyze and name each data symbol.

---

## Phase 0 — Gather Context & Entropy Unpack Check

Before starting or launching any subagents, you must gather context and check if the binary is packed/compressed.

1. **Get Binary Info**: Call `r2000_get_binary_info`.
   - Read the returned `"entropy"` value.
   - Also read the description of the `r2000_get_binary_info` tool (e.g. from `tools/list`) to find the entropy threshold preference (e.g., `7.5`).
   - If the binary's `entropy` is greater than or equal to the threshold (values above the threshold suggest the binary might be compressed):
     - **Ask the user** (using regular text in chat) if they would like to unpack the binary before proceeding with the analysis.
     - **If the user accepts**:
       - Call the `r2000_unpack_binary` tool.
       - Note: `r2000_unpack_binary` is a destructive action (clears existing comments/labels/blocks) and may take up to 10 seconds or more.
       - **If `r2000_unpack_binary` returns an error**: The binary was not unpacked. Log the failure and continue the analysis on the current binary.
       - **If it succeeds**: The binary has been unpacked and a new unpacked binary has been loaded in its place. **You must restart this phase (Phase 0) from scratch**, calling `r2000_get_binary_info` again to fetch the new unpacked binary's info and continue.
     - **If the user declines**: Continue the analysis on the current binary.

## Phase 1 — Classify Blocks (`r2000-analyze-blocks`)

Block classification is a prerequisite for all subsequent analysis.

1. Read the skill file at `.agent/skills/r2000-analyze-blocks/SKILL.md`.
2. Execute the `r2000-analyze-blocks` workflow **directly** (not via a subagent — this is a single long-running pass over the entire binary that you perform yourself).

---

## Phase 2 — Analyze Routines (parallel subagents)

**Goal**: For every subroutine that hasn't been analyzed yet, launch a subagent to analyze it.

### 2.1 Identify Unanalyzed Subroutines

A subroutine is considered **already analyzed** if its entry point has **any line comment** (the presence of a line comment indicates it has already been documented).

To build the candidate list:

1. Call `r2000_get_symbols` to get all labels (user + system), including external labels, and save the symbols since they will be used later.
2. Call `r2000_get_comments` to get all the comments, and save the comments since they will be used later.
3. Filter labels that represent subroutine entry points:
   - Labels whose name starts with `s_` (auto-generated subroutine labels), OR
   - Labels in a `Code` block that are the target of at least one `JSR` cross-reference, OR
   - **Pointer-to-code labels** — any `p_XXXX` label that is inside a `Code` block. These are addresses referenced as pointers (via immediate lo/hi byte loads like `LDX #<addr` / `LDY #>addr`, or stored in address tables) and point to executable code. They are almost always one of:
     - **Chained raster IRQ handlers**: In C64/C128 demos, multiple raster interrupts are "chained" — each handler sets the _next_ handler's address into the IRQ vector (`$0314`/`$0315`) via a helper routine. The pointer labels are created from the `LDX #<p_XXXX` / `LDY #>p_XXXX` immediate loads, not from direct vector writes. This is the most common case.
     - **NMI/IRQ handlers** loaded directly into hardware vectors (`$FFFA`–`$FFFF`) or shadow vectors (`$0314`/`$0315`, `$0318`/`$0319`).
     - **Jump table targets** or **callback pointers** stored via indirect addressing.
     - Since all of these are code entry points that deserve analysis, treat **every `p_XXXX` label in a Code block** as a routine candidate. This avoids the need for fragile pattern-matching against specific vector addresses or instruction sequences.
   - **Entry point label** — a label named exactly `start`. This is the program's entry point and is critical for understanding the overall program flow.
4. For each candidate, check if it already has a line comment (from the refreshed `r2000_get_comments` data). If yes → **skip it** (already documented).
5. The remaining list = **unanalyzed routines**.
6. **Ordering**: If `start` is in the unanalyzed list, it must be placed **first** — it is the program entry point and should be analyzed before all other routines. This ensures that the entry-point context is available when analyzing subsequent routines.

### 2.2 Launch Parallel Subagents

- **CRITICAL**: Always launch each subagent with an explicit target address (e.g., `$XXXX` or decimal `NNNNN`). **NEVER** use the "current cursor address" or rely on the active cursor location in the editor, as the cursor will change dynamically when running parallel subagents.
- Use a **rolling window** of up to **7 concurrent subagents** (to avoid hitting rate limit quota errors like `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`).
- For each subagent, provide this prompt:

  > Read the skill file at `.agent/skills/r2000-analyze-routine/SKILL.md` and follow its workflow.
  >
  > Analyze the routine at address `$XXXX` (decimal: NNNNN).
  >
  > Binary info: system = {system}, filename = {filename}, description = {description}, may_contain_undocumented_opcodes = {hint}.
  >
  > **Apply all changes automatically** — rename the label, add the header comment block, add side comments to key instructions, and apply low/high byte formatting (`r2000_set_immediate_format`) to any immediate pointer loads. Do NOT ask for user confirmation.
  >
  > When done, report: the new label name, a one-line summary of what the routine does, and any uncertain areas.

- **Rolling window strategy**:
  1. Launch the first 7 subagents (or fewer if the queue is smaller) to fill all slots.
  2. When **any** subagent completes, immediately launch the **next** routine from the queue into the freed slot — do NOT wait for the entire batch to finish.
  3. Continue until all routines in the queue have been launched and all subagents have completed.
  4. This keeps utilization high — if one subagent is slow, the other 6 slots stay busy.
  5. **Error Fallback**: If any subagent encounters a quota or model capacity error (e.g., `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` / Code 429), immediately catch the failure, log it, and queue the routine to be processed sequentially or directly by the parent orchestrator after a brief delay.

### 2.3 Post-Phase Refresh

After all routine subagents complete:

- Call `r2000_save_project` to persist changes so far.

---

## Phase 3 — Analyze Symbols (parallel subagents)

**Goal**: For every data symbol and external jump symbol (internal + external) that hasn't been analyzed yet, launch a subagent.

### 3.1 Identify Unanalyzed Symbols

A symbol is considered **already analyzed** if:

- It has a **user-defined** name (i.e., NOT an auto-generated prefix name like `a_XXXX`, `f_XXXX`, `p_XXXX`, `zpa_XX`, `zpf_XX`, `zpp_XX`, `e_XXXX`), OR
- It is a well-known system address (hardware register, KERNAL entry point, OS variable).

To build the candidate list:

1. Call `r2000_get_symbols` again (labels were renamed by subagents).
2. From the refreshed `r2000_get_symbols` data, collect all labels whose name matches auto-generated patterns:
   - `zpp_XX`, `zpf_XX` and `zpa_XX` — auto-generated pointers, fields and absolute addresses in the zero page.
   - `p_XXXX`, `f_XXXX`, `a_XXXX` and `e_XXXX` — auto-generated pointers, fields, absolute addresses, and external ROM jump vectors outside the zero page.
3. Do **NOT** include:
   - `s_XXXX` labels — those were handled in Phase 2.
   - `b_XXXX` labels — those are branch labels, not data symbols.
   - `p_XXXX` labels that are inside a `Code` block — those were handled as routine candidates in Phase 2.
4. The remaining list = **unanalyzed symbols**.

### 3.2 Launch Parallel Subagents

- **CRITICAL**: Always launch each subagent with an explicit target address (e.g., `$XXXX` or decimal `NNNNN`). **NEVER** use the "current cursor address" or rely on the active cursor location in the editor, as the cursor will change dynamically when running parallel subagents.
- Same **rolling window** strategy as Phase 2: up to **7 concurrent subagents** (to avoid hitting rate limit quota errors like `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`).
- For each subagent, provide this prompt:

  > Read the skill file at `.agent/skills/r2000-analyze-symbol/SKILL.md` and follow its workflow.
  >
  > Analyze the symbol at address `$XXXX` (decimal: NNNNN). Current label: `{current_label}`.
  >
  > Binary info: system = {system}, filename = {filename}, description = {description}, may_contain_undocumented_opcodes = {hint}.
  >
  > **Apply all changes automatically** — rename the label, add comments (line and/or side), and apply low/high byte formatting (`r2000_set_immediate_format`) to any instructions initializing the symbol. Do NOT ask for user confirmation.
  >
  > When done, report: the old label, the new label name, the classification (flag, counter, pointer, state variable, etc.), and any uncertain areas.

- As each subagent completes, immediately launch the next symbol from the queue into the freed slot.
- **Error Fallback**: If any subagent encounters a quota or model capacity error (e.g., `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` / Code 429), immediately catch the failure, log it, and queue the symbol to be processed sequentially or directly by the parent orchestrator after a brief delay.

### 3.3 Post-Phase Refresh

After all symbol subagents complete:

- Call `r2000_save_project` to persist all changes.

---

## Phase 4 — Save & Report

1. Call `r2000_save_project` one final time to ensure everything is persisted.
2. Create a **summary report** for the user, including:

### Blocks Summary

- Total number of blocks classified, grouped by type (Code, Byte, Word, PETSCII, etc.).
- Notable findings from block analysis (e.g., "Found 3 text strings at $1200", "Jump table at $0A00").

### Routines Summary

- Total number of routines analyzed.
- Table of results:

  | Address | Old Label | New Label       | Summary                                 |
  | ------- | --------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
  | `$C000` | `s_C000`  | `init_screen`   | Clears screen RAM and sets border color |
  | `$C050` | `s_C050`  | `read_joystick` | Reads CIA1 port A for joystick 2 input  |
  | ...     | ...       | ...             | ...                                     |

### Symbols Summary

- Total number of symbols analyzed.
- Table of results:

  | Address | Old Label | New Label       | Classification        |
  | ------- | --------- | --------------- | --------------------- |
  | `$02`   | `zpp_02`  | `ptr_screen`    | Pointer (ZP indirect) |
  | `$0400` | `a_0400`  | `score_display` | Screencode buffer     |
  | ...     | ...       | ...             | ...                   |

### Uncertain Items

- List any routines or symbols that subagents flagged as uncertain or could not fully determine.
- These are candidates for manual review by the user.

### Errors, Resource Quotas & Fallbacks

- **CRITICAL**: Log any subagents that encountered errors, timeouts, or API capacity limits (e.g. `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` / Code 429) during analysis.
- Include a structured table detailing:
  - The target address.
  - The symbol/routine entry point name.
  - The planned subagent analysis role.
  - The specific error code/message encountered (e.g. `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED (code 429)`).
  - The fallback handling mechanism used (e.g. "Resolved directly and sequentially by the parent orchestrator").

---

## Error Handling

- If a subagent fails, times out, or hits a rate limit (e.g. `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` / Code 429), **log the failure**, cleanly terminate the background task if necessary, and fallback to direct sequential analysis of the failed target.
- **CRITICAL**: Do NOT discard or ignore these failures. You **MUST** document all such failed subagent targets, their addresses, error codes/messages, and their fallback resolutions in the final summary report under the dedicated "Errors, Resource Quotas & Fallbacks" section.
- If `r2000_save_project` fails, warn the user immediately.

---

## Example Invocation

The user says:

> "Analyze this program"

The agent:

1. Reads this skill file.
2. Gathers context (Phase 0).
3. Classifies blocks (Phase 1) — this may take several minutes for large binaries.
4. Identifies 8 unanalyzed subroutines → launches 7 subagents, and as each one finishes immediately launches the next from the remaining 0 (Phase 2).
5. Identifies 70 unanalyzed symbols → launches 7 subagents, and as each one finishes immediately launches the next from the remaining 63 (Phase 3).
6. Saves and produces the summary report (Phase 4).
